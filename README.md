# Payment.QrPayload
This project generates payment QR codes from structured text data. Users can input payment information such as identifiers, amount, and transaction details, which are encoded into a scannable QR code for fast and secure payments via banking apps or e-wallets. The solution is lightweight, flexible, and easy to integrate.
